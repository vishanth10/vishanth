My journey began with a BS in Industrial Engineering and a minor in CS from [NIT-T](https://www.nitt.edu/), leading me to a role as a Software Developer at Citi's [PSM Division](http://www.citi.com), before diving deep into the realms of AI and Operations.

### Passion for Technology 🚀

My expertise lies in **Generative AI and Machine Learning**, fields that are reshaping our world. With proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, and C/C++, I'm dedicated to solving complex problems and making a societal impact through technology.
