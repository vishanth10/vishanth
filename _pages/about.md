## Welcome! 👋

I'm Vishanth Hari Raj, a Master's student at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), specializing in Business Analytics. My journey began with a BS in Industrial Engineering and a minor in CS from [NIT-T](https://www.nitt.edu/), leading me to a role as a Software Developer at Citi's [PSM Division](http://www.citi.com), before diving deep into the realms of AI and Operations.

### Passion for Technology 🚀

My expertise lies in **Generative AI and Machine Learning**, fields that are reshaping our world. With proficiency in Python, TensorFlow, and C/C++, I'm dedicated to solving complex problems and making a societal impact through technology.

### My Mission 🌟

As I navigate through my MS at UCLA, my goal is to harness data science and machine learning for innovative solutions. **I'm open to summer 2024 internships and full-time roles starting December 2024** in Data Science and ML/AI domains.

Let's connect and explore how we can drive technological advancements together!

*Here's to creating a future driven by data and innovation.* 🌐❤️
